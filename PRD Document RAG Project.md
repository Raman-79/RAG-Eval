## **Product Requirements Document (PRD) — RAG Evaluator**

---

## **Product Overview**

RAG Evaluator is a comprehensive evaluation platform tailored for teams building and deploying Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. It enables systematic, scalable, and data-driven evaluation of both retrieval and generation components, helping ensure high-quality, factual, and reliable AI outputs backed by relevant context.

---

## **Goals and Objectives**

* Provide an end-to-end evaluation toolkit for RAG pipelines.  
* Enable teams to benchmark retrievers and generators separately or combined.  
* Offer customizable metrics and evaluators suited for domain-specific RAG use cases.  
* Streamline decision-making with detailed visual analytics and comparison capabilities.

---

## **User Requirements**

* Create and manage multiple evaluation projects for different RAG system variations.  
* Build or import test datasets reflecting query, retrieval context, and expected response.  
* Connect to API providers for retriever and generator models.  
* Run automated and human evaluations on both retriever and generator outputs.  
* Visualize and export comprehensive results covering retrieval accuracy, faithfulness, hallucination, relevancy, and more.
