# Frontend Requirements Document - RAG Evaluator

## Frontend Development Starting Strategy

### 1. **Project Setup (Week 1)**
- **Use Vite** instead of Create React App (faster, modern)
- **TypeScript from day one** - strict mode enabled
- **Tailwind CSS** with custom design system
- **ESLint + Prettier** for code quality
- **React Router v6** for navigation
- **Simple folder structure** to start

### 2. **Component Architecture (Week 2)**
- **Atomic Design approach**: Atoms → Molecules → Organisms → Templates → Pages
- **Reusable component library** with Tailwind
- **Component composition** over inheritance
- **Props interfaces** for all components
- **Storybook setup** for component documentation

### 3. **State Management (Week 3)**
- **Start with React Context** (simpler for MVP)
- **Custom hooks** for business logic
- **Local state** for component-specific data
- **Lift state up** only when necessary
- **Consider Zustand** if Context becomes complex

## Key Development Principles

### 4. **Mobile-First Approach**
- **Tailwind breakpoints** from `sm:` up
- **Touch-friendly** interface elements
- **Responsive navigation** (hamburger menu)
- **Mobile-optimized forms**

### 5. **Form Management Strategy**
- **React Hook Form** for performance
- **Zod validation** with TypeScript
- **Form state persistence** (localStorage)
- **Error handling** with user-friendly messages
- **Progressive disclosure** for complex forms

### 6. **Data Fetching Pattern**
- **Custom hooks** for API calls
- **Loading states** for all async operations
- **Error boundaries** for graceful failures
- **Optimistic updates** for better UX
- **Simple caching** with React Query later

## MVP Development Priority

### 7. **Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-3)**
```
✅ Project setup
✅ Basic routing
✅ Authentication pages
✅ Component library foundation
✅ Basic state management
```

### 8. **Phase 2: Core Features (Weeks 4-6)**
```
✅ Project dashboard
✅ Project creation flow
✅ Dataset management
✅ Basic evaluation interface
✅ Simple results view
```

### 9. **Phase 3: Polish (Weeks 7-8)**
```
✅ Error handling
✅ Loading states
✅ Responsive design
✅ Basic accessibility
✅ User testing
```

## Technical Decisions for Easier Development

### 10. **Choose Simplicity Over Complexity**
- **Single page routing** initially
- **Modal-based forms** instead of complex wizards
- **Inline editing** where possible
- **Progressive enhancement** approach
- **Feature flags** for gradual rollout

### 11. **Development Tools Setup**
- **Hot reload** with Vite
- **TypeScript strict mode** for catching errors early
- **Tailwind IntelliSense** extension
- **React DevTools** for debugging
- **Simple testing** with React Testing Library

### 12. **Code Organization Strategy**
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── ui/           # Reusable UI components
│   ├── forms/        # Form-specific components
│   └── layout/       # Layout components
├── hooks/            # Custom hooks
├── pages/            # Page components
├── services/         # API calls
├── types/            # TypeScript interfaces
├── utils/            # Helper functions
└── context/          # React Context providers
```

## Key Considerations for Easier Development

### 13. **Avoid Common Pitfalls**
- **Don't over-engineer** state management initially
- **Don't create too many** abstract components early
- **Don't optimize** performance prematurely
- **Don't implement** complex features before basics work
- **Don't skip** TypeScript interfaces

### 14. **Focus on User Experience**
- **Clear navigation** between features
- **Consistent design** patterns
- **Immediate feedback** for user actions
- **Error prevention** over error handling
- **Progressive disclosure** of complexity

### 15. **Development Workflow**
- **Component-driven development** (build components first)
- **Mobile-first responsive design**
- **Regular user testing** with simple prototypes
- **Incremental feature addition**
- **Continuous refactoring** as patterns emerge

## Quick Start Checklist

- [ ] **Vite + React + TypeScript** project
- [ ] **Tailwind CSS** with custom colors
- [ ] **Basic routing** (Home, Login, Dashboard)
- [ ] **Simple authentication** (mock for now)
- [ ] **Component library** (Button, Input, Card, Modal)
- [ ] **Basic state management** with Context
- [ ] **Form handling** with React Hook Form
- [ ] **Responsive layout** foundation
- [ ] **Error boundaries** setup
- [ ] **Basic testing** configuration

## Development Tips

1. **Start with static data** - mock APIs initially
2. **Build one feature completely** before moving to next
3. **Use Tailwind's utility classes** instead of custom CSS
4. **Keep components small** and focused
5. **Test on mobile devices** from the beginning
6. **Document component APIs** as you build
7. **Refactor early** when patterns emerge
8. **Use TypeScript strict mode** to catch issues early

This approach will give you a solid foundation that's easy to build upon and won't require major refactoring as you add features.
